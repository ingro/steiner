## Steiner-demo

- Breadcrumbs: wait for a better implementation of [react-router-addons-routes](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router-addons-routes) to find nested routes easily
- Sync between filters and browser url (wait for React-Router ControlledRouter with Redux, see this example https://github.com/este/este/pull/1156/files -> src/browser/app/Root.js)
- Better navbar (improve breadcrumb styles, show username, dropdown with options)
- Omnibox -> missing styles
- Add shortcut to toggle the sidebar
- Keyboard shortcuts -> example in demo (HotelsEdit and HotelsListFilter), how to include them?
- Helper with shortcuts
- Bug: transitioning from /posts/5 to /posts/create doesn't reset the form
- Write a simple getting started guide after bootstrap a new app with `steiner-cli`
