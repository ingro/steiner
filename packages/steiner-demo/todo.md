## Steiner-demo

- Breadcrumbs: wait for a better implementation of [react-router-addons-routes](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router-addons-routes) to find nested routes easily
- Write a simple getting started guide after bootstrap a new app with `steiner-cli`
- Use user's settings value for number of rows displayed in tables?
- Use all the helpers from SteinerHelper
- Use [redux-seamless-immutable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-seamless-immutable)?
- Change ViviProvider to be a generic translations provider and use it with Steiner
- BUG: Wrapping a Link with a Tooltip results in a page change
