## Steiner-demo

- Breadcrumbs: wait for a better implementation of [react-router-addons-routes](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router-addons-routes) to find nested routes easily
- Sync between filters and browser url (wait for React-Router ControlledRouter with Redux, see this example https://github.com/este/este/pull/1156/files -> src/browser/app/Root.js)
- Better navbar (improve breadcrumb styles, show username, dropdown with options)
- Omnibar?
- Keyboard shortcuts -> example in demo (HotelsEdit and HotelsListFilter), how to include them?
