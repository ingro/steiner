## Steiner-demo

- Breadcrumbs: wait for a better implementation of [react-router-addons-routes](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router-addons-routes) to find nested routes easily
- Write a simple getting started guide after bootstrap a new app with `steiner-cli`
- Use user's settings value for number of rows displayed in tables?
- Use all the helpers from SteinerHelper
- Move API_PATH e LOGIN_PATH inside .env file
- Add more options to configure messages in various language (Provider like Vivi?)
