## Steiner-demo

- Breadcrumbs: wait for a better implementation of [react-router-addons-routes](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router-addons-routes) to find nested routes easily
- Write a simple getting started guide after bootstrap a new app with `steiner-cli`
- Use user's settings value for number of rows displayed in tables?
- Use all the helpers from SteinerHelper
- Use [redux-seamless-immutable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-seamless-immutable)?
- BUG: Wrapping a Link with a Tooltip results in a page change
- Add a language option for user in store, when changed force a refresh of the page to translate all the app
