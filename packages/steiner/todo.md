# Steiner

- Better naming/organization of things
- Better way to export modules for easier imports -> some improvements done, now almost all the most used function can be import from 'steiner'
- Use NamedLink from [react-router-addons-routes](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router-addons-routes) to generate Links to routes?
- Add tests
- Optimistically update items on update?
- Add all the missing helper's function on SteinerHelper
- Pass only the minimum state/actions from redux's connect?
- Move SteinerHelper in its own file
